# BubbleShooter
Bubble Shooter is a simple interactive game. The goal of the game is to clear the playing field by forming groups of three or more like-colored marbles. The game ends when the balls reach the bottom line of the screen. The more balls destroyed in one shot, the more points scored. A player wins when there are no balls remaining on the playing field. I developed this game using the below tools for a study of openGL:
1. OpenGL
2. C++
